# Leek LLM ðŸ¥¬

Can a LLM create the ultimate Leek AI for [Leek Wars](https://leekwars.com)? 

This is something I threw together over the weekend to learn how to use [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/). It creates a multi-agent conversation that writes and runs LeekScript with a feedback loop so the LLM can improve the code after every fight.

So far mixed results, but there's so much to potentially add and optimize!
