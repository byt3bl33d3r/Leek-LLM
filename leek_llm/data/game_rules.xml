Each Leek can equip [[Weapons]], [[Chips]] and [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] to fight.

Your leek's skin evolves according to the level, when it crosses certain levels.

Your leek can also leave the vegetable garden to avoid aggression from other leeks when you go on vacation, for example. To do this, simply modify the "Garden" status indicator from Yes to No on the page of the leek in question. Thus, your leek will no longer be suggested in the vegetable garden of other leeks.

A leek also has many characteristics which are described on this page: [[Characteristics]]</leek>
