# TO DO

1. Figure out how to correctly get warnings and errors from fights
2. Allow engineer to query via RAG the standard LeekScript functions
3. Give back the fight results in a more comprehensible format to the LLM (Maybe multimodal? just screenshot the fight graphs from the UI?)
4. Give the game rules to the LLM
